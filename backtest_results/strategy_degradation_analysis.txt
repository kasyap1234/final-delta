====================================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================================================================================================

The strategy has shown significant degradation in performance from 2023 to 2025:

- 2023: Strong performance with +18.10% return, 2.08 Sharpe ratio, 58.16% win rate
- 2024: Poor performance with only +1.66% return, 0.24 Sharpe ratio, 37.63% win rate  
- 2025: Negative performance with -2.43% return, -0.42 Sharpe ratio, 32.67% win rate

The strategy has gone from a profitable, high-performance system to a losing strategy
over the course of three years, indicating fundamental issues with the strategy's
ability to adapt to changing market conditions.


====================================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
====================================================================================================

1. WIN RATE DEGRADATION
   - 2023: 58.16% win rate
   - 2024: 37.63% win rate (decrease of 20.53%)
   - 2025: 32.67% win rate (decrease of 25.49%)
   
   The win rate has dropped by 43.8% from 2023 to 2025,
   indicating the strategy's signals have become significantly less accurate.


2. STOP LOSS HIT RATE INCREASE
   - 2023: 43.88% of trades hit stop loss
   - 2024: 63.44% of trades hit stop loss
   - 2025: 67.33% of trades hit stop loss
   
   The stop loss hit rate increased by 23.45 percentage points,
   showing that trades are moving against the strategy more frequently.
   
   Take profit rates:
   - 2023: 56.12%
   - 2024: 36.56%
   - 2025: 32.67%


3. AVERAGE PROFITABILITY PER TRADE
   - 2023: $18.75 average P&L per trade
   - 2024: $3.42 average P&L per trade
   - 2025: $-3.00 average P&L per trade
   
   The average profit per trade has declined significantly, turning negative in 2025.
   This indicates that even winning trades are capturing less profit.


4. CONSECUTIVE LOSS STREAKS
   - 2023: Maximum 9 consecutive losses
   - 2024: Maximum 7 consecutive losses
   - 2025: Maximum 10 consecutive losses
   
   The maximum consecutive loss streak has increased, indicating more prolonged
   periods of poor performance and potential strategy breakdown.


5. SYMBOL-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CHANGES
--------------------------------------------------

   BTC/USDT:
   - 2023: 37 trades, $440.66 P&L, 56.76% win rate
   - 2024: 31 trades, $388.56 P&L, 45.16% win rate
   - 2025: 34 trades, $-147.26 P&L, 29.41% win rate


   ETH/USDT:
   - 2023: 29 trades, $269.05 P&L, 58.62% win rate

   - 2025: 30 trades, $110.14 P&L, 40.00% win rate


   SOL/USDT:
   - 2023: 32 trades, $1127.55 P&L, 59.38% win rate

   - 2025: 37 trades, $-266.27 P&L, 29.73% win rate


====================================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
====================================================================================================

Based on the data analysis, the following factors appear to be driving the strategy degradation:

1. MARKET REGIME CHANGE (2023-2024)
   - 2023 featured a strong crypto bull market recovery from 2022 lows
   - 2024 saw increased volatility and choppy price action
   - The strategy appears optimized for trending markets and struggles in range-bound conditions

2. INCREASED STOP LOSS HITS
   - The dramatic increase in stop loss hits suggests:
     a) Tighter stops may be getting triggered by normal market noise
     b) Entry timing has become less accurate
     c) Market volatility patterns have changed

3. REDUCED PROFIT CAPTURE
   - Average win size has decreased while average loss size has remained similar or increased
   - This indicates the risk/reward ratio has deteriorated
   - Take profit levels may be too ambitious for current market conditions

4. TRADE FREQUENCY INCREASE (2025)
   - 2025 shows more trades (101) compared to 2023 (98) and 2024 (93)
   - More trades with lower win rate suggests over-trading
   - Strategy may be generating false signals in current market conditions

5. SYMBOL-SPECIFIC BREAKDOWN
   - SOL/USDT showed strong performance in 2023 but deteriorated significantly
   - BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT also show declining performance
   - All symbols affected suggests a systematic issue rather than symbol-specific


====================================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
====================================================================================================

1. RISK PARAMETER ADJUSTMENTS
   - Widen stop loss levels to avoid noise-driven exits
   - Consider dynamic position sizing based on market volatility
   - Implement tighter take profits to secure gains in choppy markets

2. MARKET REGIME DETECTION
   - Add market regime detection (trending vs ranging)
   - Reduce position sizes or pause trading during unfavorable regimes
   - Implement volatility filters to avoid trading in low-probability conditions

3. SIGNAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS
   - Add additional confirmation indicators to reduce false signals
   - Implement multi-timeframe analysis for better entry timing
   - Consider volume-based filters to avoid low-liquidity entries

4. PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION
   - The strategy appears over-concentrated in similar crypto assets
   - Consider adding uncorrelated assets or strategies
   - Implement correlation-based position sizing

5. BACKTEST ROBUSTNESS
   - The 2023 results may be overfitted to that specific market condition
   - Test strategy across multiple market regimes
   - Implement walk-forward analysis to validate robustness

6. DYNAMIC PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION
   - Implement periodic re-optimization of strategy parameters
   - Use rolling window optimization to adapt to changing conditions
   - Consider machine learning for adaptive parameter adjustment

7. RISK MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS
   - Implement maximum daily/weekly loss limits
   - Add correlation-based risk limits
   - Consider portfolio heat management (total risk exposure)


====================================================================================================
CONCLUSION
====================================================================================================

The strategy has experienced significant degradation from 2023 to 2025, transitioning from
a profitable system to a losing one. The primary causes appear to be:

1. Market regime changes that the strategy is not adapted to handle
2. Over-optimization to 2023 market conditions
3. Inadequate risk parameters for current volatility levels
4. Signal quality deterioration in ranging/choppy markets

Immediate action is required to either:
- Significantly modify the strategy to handle current market conditions
- Temporarily halt trading until market conditions become more favorable
- Implement the recommended improvements before deploying capital

Without these changes, the strategy is likely to continue underperforming and
potentially lead to further capital erosion.
